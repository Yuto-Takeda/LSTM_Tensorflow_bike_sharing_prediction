# Overview
This is the project which predict the demand of bike sharing using **LSTM** model through **Tensorflow**. As for the dataset, I used it from Kaggle.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset).
Specifically, I predicted the number of bike sharing on a given day using information on time series and temperature.

The MSE(mean_squared_error) of the LSTM model is 150594, and the RMSE is 388. 
The following image shows the learning curve of the LSTM model.

The following images are the result of the LSTM model.
