# Overview
This is the project which predict the demand of bike sharing using *LSTM* model through *Tensorflow*. As for the dataset, I used it from Kaggle.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset).
Specifically, I predicted the number of bike sharing on a given day using information on time series and temperature.

The MSE(mean_squared_error) of the LSTM model is 150594, and the RMSE is 388. 
The following image shows the learning curve of the LSTM model.
